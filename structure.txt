The robot is in a “glove box”. The task is to pick colored vials and put them in a centrifuge.
The user is outside of the glove box and uses a UI to select which vial to pick and which one to put in the centrifuge.
Then the robot picks the vials back and puts them on the rack.


Application structure:
    Need to do some design work for the window.
    Main window:
        Displays the status of the rack
        Displays the status of the centrifuge


    Setup window:
        Jog panel and locked with passwords
        Lets you add points to the rack and centrifuge
        Must be able to import the points from text file for speedy setup and use with the web interface.

    "Processing" simulation window:
        Progress bar that simulates the centrifuge processing the samples.



Object list:
App object:
    Contains the whole app and UI

Vial object:
    Might not be necessary for our application but would be useful for better tracking in a real application.

Rack_socket object:
    An object that will be generated inside the Main_rack class. Will track the status of the rack and could be used to add more info in a real application.
    Attributes:
        status : empty or not
        position : Where in the rack is it in (x,y,z,rx,ry,rz)
        vial_object: Not used but would contain the info of the vial if the Vial object was used.

Main_rack object:
    Object that tracks the status of the main rack
    Attributes:
        Vial_sockets: List of the number of vial sockets in the rack.

Centrifuge_socket object:
    Similar to the Rack_socket object but might have some extra options such as controlling LEDs.

Centrifuge_Object:
    Object that tracks the status of the centrifuge object

Robot object:
    mecademicpy.robot.Robot object to control the robot
    This one already exist but will be inside the App.
